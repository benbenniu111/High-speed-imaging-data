The video is taken with high-speed camera whose sampling rate is 2000 frame per second under 128x128 pixel focal plane arrays. There is a point target in the video, which can be used for target detection. The point target is a small ball thrown out by an experimenter. The detecting result is also shown, which can be used for comparison.
